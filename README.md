# Twitter-API-and-NLP
I built a sentiment comparison program using NLP (Natural Language Processing) and Twitter API. This Python project uses some of NLP libraries such as TextBlob.

1) You need to install certain libraries before run the code.

Tweepy: This library allows Python to access the Twitter platform/database using its API.
(pip install tweepy)

TextBlob: It is a Python library for processing textual data. It helps in diving into common natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, classification, translation, and more.
(pip install -U textblob)

2) To connect your Twitter API, you need to create developer Twitter account. Then you can generate consumer key, and consumer secret.
